# Motivation

- Blackjack is a game I absolutely love, but luck has never really been on my side. Casino games can be a bit tricky, so I decided to create my own blackjack game. The problem? I still keep losing!

# Running

- While in the file path, execute the following command.. Good luck!

```bash

python main.py

```
